How many times have you vomited or had diarrhea since the symptoms started? I vomited about three times and gone to the bathroom maybe six times. It all started around 11 PM. Have you had any fever or chills? Yes, I had a fever this morning. I think it reached 38 degrees Celsius. Have you noticed any blood in your stools or vomit? No, just very watery and yellowish. Did you eat anything outside the house in the last 24 hours? Maybe something that didn't seem right? I had lunch at a restaurant yesterday. I ate chicken and rice, but it tasted a bit strange. I see. Do you have any significant medical history? Are you on any regular medications? No, I'm generally healthy. I'm only allergic to penicillin. Okay, have you been able to stay hydrated? Are you drinking water or oral rehydration? I've tried drinking."
